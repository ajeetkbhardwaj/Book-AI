Definition of Vectorization

1. 

2. 

Case-1 : Vectorization faster than for-loop

Case-2 : Vectorization slower than for-loop

Limitations of Vectorization

How CPU and GPU differs in their approach to parallel computation

Case-1 : GPU faster than CPU

Case-2 : CPU faster than GPU

If GPU is always faster than CPU for deep learning then why do we still need CPU ?

Define Multi-threading

Define Multi-processing

Define Multi-worker distributed computing

How do we decide when to use vectorization vs. multithreading vs. multiprocessing vs. multi-worker computing?

Scale of data and Complexity of operation
